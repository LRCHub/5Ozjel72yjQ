Well all people hanging around
Well all people ghouling around
We were city ghosts
We just follow 'cause we are just people
Yeah, city walls are growing
How will I find my way out?
We were wasted life's in the city
Where a million people stole my way
Where have we gone?
I'm staying around
Where have you gone?
I'm sticking around
I'm going inbound  inside the city walls
Inbound, inside the city walls
It's getting kinda mystic
Going inbound
Yeah, city walls are growing
How will I find my way out?
We were wasted life's in the city
Where a million of people stole my way
Yeah, city walls are growing
How will I find my way out?
We were wasted life's in the city
Where a million of people stole my way
