Square up with me,
I can take your right,
throw a left
Pair up with me,
I'ma take you right to
the chest
Warpath etched in the surface
Lines of the yellow tape,
they're moving quiet like a
Serpentine in a formation
Buddy, that's my team,
pretty impatient
Now they're waiting on me
It might be the furthest
we've reached
Now move it up, move it up,
it's a breach
I wonder where you are
I wanted you to show me
The way around the city walls
The way on through
I wonder where you are
I wanted you to show me
But now the night has fallen
Abandoned by the sun
Square up with me,
I can come to you, tell me when
Pair up with me,
I can run on you, in the end
I write a promise in pencil,
but my loyalty's in pen
Use a mistake as
a crooked stencil,
then we trace it back again
From the mainland to the
island of violence
It was the same plan
for a while,
decided
To send me up and rip you out
of your seat
You see,
in a city with no entrance,
there is not a retreat
I'm wondering what you
thought would happen,
who you thought I would be
Was this a side-swipe or did
you picture this in a dream?
Buckle down,
this is possibly the
furthest we've reached
Now move it up, move it up,
it's a breach
I wonder where you are
I wanted you to show me
The way around the city walls
The way on through
I wonder where you are
I wanted you to show me
But now the night has fallen
Abandoned by the sun
Abandoned by the sun
My smile wraps around my head,
splitting it in
Two, two, two, two
I don't have a clue how
I can keep the top half
Glued, glued, glued, glued
My smile wraps around my head,
splitting it in
Two, two, two, two
I don't have a clue how
I can keep the top half
Glued, glued, glued, glued
I wonder where you are
I wanted you to show me
Entertain my, entertain my
Entertain my, entertain my
Entertain my, entertain my
Entertain my, entertain my faith
This is the last time,
this is the last time
Entertain my faith
This is the last time that I try
Address my soul,
address my soul,
address my soul
Entertain my faith
This is the last time that I try
